            My journey of exploring plant-based diet began as a flexitarian a few years ago when I developed a desire <br>
            to become more conscious about food and its impact on my health and the environment. Today, I have <br>
            adopted a vegan lifestyle and my health has improved exponentially whereby I benefit from well being,<br>
            weight loss and healthier skin.
            <br>
            <br>
            I am passionate about culinary art, healthy eating, and exploring new recipes from different cultures. My <br>
            passion for culinary art and healthy eating has enabled me to become creative to explore new ingredients,<br>
            food and recipes from across the world.
            <br>
            <br>
            This blog and along with my ebook document plant- based recipes I have developed over several years. The <br>
            purpose of this eBook and this blog  is to share the plant-based recipes, my knowledge about healthy eating <br>
            and nutrition.
            <br>
            <br>
            The recipes I share in this blog are relatively simple and easy to make and I would highly encourage you to <br>
            commit to trying them out. I would love to hear feedback about the recipes once you try them.
            <br>
            <br>
            If you like my blog and eBook, then share it with your friends and family members.
